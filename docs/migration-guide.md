## Summary

Here is a general view of the steps you should take to migrate your application to Cats Effect 3:

1. [Make sure your dependencies have upgraded](#make-sure-your-dependencies-have-upgraded)<!-- don't remove this comment - this ensures the vscode extension doesn't make this a ToC -->
1. [Run the Scalafix migration](#run-the-scalafix-migration) (optional)
2. [Upgrade dependencies and Cats Effect itself](#upgrade-dependencies)
3. [Fix remaining compilation issues](#fix-remaining-compilation-issues)
4. [Test your application](#test-your-application). <!-- todo wording -->

### Before you begin: this isn't a "quick start" guide

This guide is meant for existing users of Cats Effect 2 who want to upgrade their applications
to 3.0.0.

> If you haven't used Cats Effect before and want to give it a try,
> please follow the [getting started guide](./getting-started.html) instead!

### ðŸ¤” Need help?

If any point of the migration turns out to be difficult and you feel like you need help, feel free to [explain your problem on Gitter](https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats-effect) and we will do our best to assist you.
If you spot a mistake in the guide or the library itself, you can [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/new).

### Context: what's changed, what's the same?

Cats Effect 3 (CE3 for short) is a complete redesign of the library.
Some abstractions known from Cats Effect 2 (CE2) have been removed, others changed responsibilities, and finally, new abstractions were introduced.

The `cats.effect.IO` type known from CE2 is still there, albeit with a different place in the type class hierarchy - namely, it doesn't appear in it.

The new set of type classes has been designed in a way that deliberately avoids coupling with `IO`, which makes the library more modular,
and allows library authors (as well as users of other effect types) to omit that dependency from their builds.

## Make sure your dependencies have upgraded

Before you make any changes to your build or your code, you should make sure all of your direct and transitive dependencies have made releases compatible with Cats Effect 3.

There isn't any automated way to do this, but you can just go ahead and [try to upgrade the dependencies](#upgrade-dependencies), then stash the changes and return to here.

If you're using an open source library that hasn't made a compatible release yet, [let us know - we are keeping track of the efforts of library authors](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/1330) to publish compatible releases as soon as possible when 3.0.0 final is out.

## Run the Scalafix migration

Many parts of this migration can be automated by using the [Scalafix][scalafix] migration.

> Note: In case of projects using Scala Steward, the migration should automatically be applied when you receive the update.

If you want to trigger the migration manually, you can follow [the instructions here](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/blob/series/3.x/scalafix/README.md). Remember to run it *before* making any changes to your dependencies' versions.

Now is the time to update cats-effect **every dependency using it** to a CE3-compatible version.

## Upgrade dependencies

At this point, if you've run the Scalafix migration, your code will not compile. However, you should hold off going through the list of errors and fixing the remaining issues yourself at this point.

If you're an [sbt][sbt] user, it is recommended that you upgrade to at least `1.5.0-RC2` before you proceed:

In your `project/build.properties`:

```diff
- sbt.version = 1.4.9
+ sbt.version = 1.5.0-RC2
```

This will enable eviction errors, which means your build will only succeed if all your dependencies
use compatible versions of each library (in the case of cats-effect, this will require your dependencies
all use either the 2.x.x versions or the 3.x.x versions).

Having upgraded sbt, you can try to upgrade cats-effect:

### Which modules should I use?

Cats Effect 3 splits the code dependency into multiple modules. If you were previously using `cats-effect`, you can keep doing so, but if you're a user of another effect system (Monix, ZIO, ...), or a library author, you might be able to depend on a subset of it instead.

The current non-test modules are:

```scala
"org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect-kernel" % "3.0.0",
"org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect-std"    % "3.0.0",
"org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect"        % "3.0.0",
```

- `kernel` - type class definitions, simple concurrency primitives
- `std` - high-level abstractions like `Console`, `Semaphore`, `Hotswap`, `Dispatcher`
- `core` - `IO`, `SyncIO`

```diff
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  //...
-  "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "2.4.0",
+  "org.typelevel" %% "cats-effect" % "3.0.0",
  //...
)
```

Then run `update` or `evicted` in sbt. You should see something like the following:

```scala
sbt:demo> update
[error] stack trace is suppressed; run last core / update for the full output
[error] (core / update) found version conflict(s) in library dependencies; some are suspected to be binary incompatible:
[error]
[error] 	* org.typelevel:cats-effect_2.13:3.0.0 (early-semver) is selected over {2.3.1, 2.1.4}
[error] 	    +- com.example:core-core_2.13:0.0.7-26-3183519d       (depends on 3.0.0)
[error] 	    +- io.monix:monix-catnap_2.13:3.3.0                   (depends on 2.1.4)
[error] 	    +- com.github.valskalla:odin-core_2.13:0.11.0         (depends on 2.3.1)
[error]
[error]
[error] this can be overridden using libraryDependencySchemes or evictionErrorLevel
[error] Total time: 0 s, completed 27 Mar 2021, 17:51:52
```

This tells you that you need to upgrade both `monix-catnap` and `odin-core` before proceeding. Make sure `update` of all your project's modules passes before proceeding to the next point.

> Note: that some of the libraries listed might be transitive dependencies, which means
> you're depending on other projects that depend on them.
> Upgrading your direct dependencies should solve the transitive dependencies' incompatibilities as well.

## Fix remaining compilation issues

Here's the new type class hierarchy. It might be helpful in understanding some of the changes:

</a>

Most of the following are handled by [the Scalafix migration](#run-the-scalafix-migration). If you can, try that first!

> Note: package name changes were skipped from the table. Most type classes are now in `cats.effect.kernel`.

TODO: IOApp

However, some changes will require more work than a simple search/replace.
We will go through them here.


### Concurrent: continual

<!-- todo explain -->

```scala mdoc
import cats.effect.kernel.MonadCancel
import cats.effect.kernel.MonadCancelThrow
import cats.syntax.all._

def continual[F[_]: MonadCancelThrow, A, B](fa: F[A])(
  f: Either[Throwable, A] => F[B]
): F[B] = MonadCancel[F].uncancelable { poll =>
  poll(fa).attempt.flatMap(f)
}
```

### Dispatcher

todo - Gavin wrote about this

#### Implementing Async

Types that used to implement `Async` but not `Concurrent` from CE2 might not be able to implement anything more than `Sync` in CE3 -
this has an impact on users who have used e.g.
[doobie](https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/)'s `ConnectionIO`, `slick.dbio.DBIO` with
[slick-effect](https://github.com/kubukoz/slick-effect), or
[ciris](https://cir.is)'s `ConfigValue` in a polymorphic context with an `Async[F]` constraint.

Please refer to each library's appropriate documentation/changelog to see how to adjust your code to this change.

#### Outcome

todo

#### shifting

The `IO.shift` / `ContextShift[F].shift` methods are gone, and they don't have a fully compatible counterpart.

In CE2, `shift` would ensure the next actions in the fiber would be scheduled on the `ExecutionContext` instance (or the `ContextShift` instance) provided in the parameter.
This was used for two reasons:

- to switch back from a thread pool not managed by the effect system (e.g. a callback handler in a Java HTTP client)
- to reschedule the fiber on the given `ExecutionContext`, which would give other fibers a chance to run on that context's threads. This is called yielding to the scheduler.

There is no longer a need for shifting back, because interop with callback-based libraries is done through methods in `Async`, which now **switch back to the appropriate thread pool automatically**.

Yielding back to the scheduler can now be done with `Spawn[F].cede`.

#### Clock changes

todo
<!-- why `create` and mapK are gone (because it's a typeclass now)  -->

#### Tracing

Currently, improved stack traces are not implemented.
There is currently [work in progress](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/pull/1763) to bring them back.

## Test your application

If you followed this guide, all your dependencies are using the 3.x releases of cats-effect, your code compiles and your tests pass,
the process is probably done - at this point you should do the usual steps you make after major changes in your application:
running integration/end to end tests, manual testing, canary deployments and any other steps that might
typically be done in your environment.

Enjoy using cats-effect!
